## Description

This folder contains other README files, screenshots, images, etc &mdash; things
that you'd want to store somewhere to include in README files or somewhere else.

If you decide to use it after all, you can remove both `.gitkeep` and this
`README.md`, just make sure you don't leave an empty folder &mdash; Git doesn't
handle them and won't track changes.
